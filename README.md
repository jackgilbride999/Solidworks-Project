# Solidworks-Project
Leaving Certificate Project for Design and Communication Graphics, 2017.
## Project Brief
Smoothie and juice makers offer users a healthy drink that can be substituted for either breakfast, lunch or as a snack. Functionality, ease of cleaning, size, accessories and appearance are often key considerations when choosing such an appliance. They are also available in a wide range of materials.

**(A)** Carry out a design investigation of existing smoothie/juice makers in graphic format. Your investigation should include an analysis of physical form, features, colour, materials etc. Choose one of the artefacts and generate a computer model, comprising at least 5 parts, an Assembly, Drawing and an eDrawing.

and

**(B)** Develop and graphically communicate a new concept design for a smoothie/juice maker based on a selected theme or aimed at a particular target market. 

## Part A - Nutribullet
After exploration of the brief and comparison of different smoothie makers on the market, the product that I chose was the Nutribullet.

## Part B - Powerblend Concept
Requirements for the concept included justification for the following key criteria:
- aesthetics
- functionality
- environmental sustainability

### Justifications Given
#### Aesthetics
- Battery style fits in with the theme of energy; the smoothie gives the consumer energy much as the battery gives
electronics energy
- It is rounded; the usual shape for a countertop smoothie maker
- The legs will be hidden from view beneath the body of the smoothie maker
- The vivid green colour gives the idea of energy and life so will appeal to a consumer looking to get healthy
#### Functionality
- The blade mechanism is a very similar mechanism to that of the Nutribullet Pro, so it is tried and tested and I know that it will work
- The main body will be most of the battery while the top will detach; this will make it easy to pour
- The hidden legs on the smoothie maker will ensure that it
remains standing and does not fall over
#### Environmental Sustainability
- The “energy” theme will remind people that energy is important and valuable in their everyday lives
- As the smoothie maker will be on full display on a kitchen counter, it will serve as a constant reminder to people not to waste energy (e.g. turning off lights when they leave their kitchen, handwashing small loads of dishes instead of putting them into a dishwasher)
- It will encourage the use and buying of fruits, which are
biodegradable 
- It will be made of recyclable materials which can be reused when the smoothie maker is no longer used by the owner
