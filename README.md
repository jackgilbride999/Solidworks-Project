# Solidworks-Project
Leaving Certificate Project for Design and Communication Graphics, 2017.
## Project Brief
Smoothie and juice makers offer users a healthy drink that can be substituted for either breakfast, lunch or as a snack. Functionality, ease of cleaning, size, accessories and appearance are often key considerations when choosing such an appliance. They are also available in a wide range of materials.
**(A)** Carry out a design investigation of existing smoothie/juice makers in graphic format. Your investigation should include an analysis of physical form, features, colour, materials etc. Choose one of the artefacts and generate a computer model, comprising at least 5 parts, an Assembly, Drawing and an eDrawing.
and
**(B)** Develop and graphically communicate a new concept design for a smoothie/juice maker based on a selected theme or aimed at a particular target market. 

## Part A
After exploration of the brief and comparison of different smoothie makers on the market, the product that I chose was the Nutribullet.
